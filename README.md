FOVOptionsPercentageValue is located in your KFGame.ini located inÂ C:\\Users\\\<user\>\\Documents\\My Games\\KillingFloor2\\KFGame\\Config

Coefficient is the screen match distance as a decimal and horizontal. So 75% is 0.75

Keybinds numpad 1-7 for each weapon type:
1 for flamethrowers, MWG, and freezethrower
2 for pistols 
3 for every SMG excluding MP7, Thompson, and Medic SMG 
4 for the grenade launchers
5 for assault rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, and MP7, Thompson, Medic SMG, and Hemoglobin
6 for the lever actions
7 for the husk cannon

I don't have the scoped weapons (crossbow, m14, railgun) working because I don't know the FOV inside scopes or how their sensitivity is calculated.
