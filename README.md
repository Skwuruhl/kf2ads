If you don't know what coefficient and mode to use, I recommend "1" for both.

Coefficient's funciton depends on the mode.

Zoom ratio scales sensitivity by the focal length then multiplies it by the coefficient. Use 1.0 by default.

Monitor distance scales sensitivity by a fov aspect ratio defined by the coefficient. Coefficient is a percent of the horizontal where 1.0 is 100%. Don't use 0 here, just use zoom ratio instead.
