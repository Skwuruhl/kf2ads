Coefficient's funciton depends on the mode.

Zoom ratio scales sensitivity by the focal length then multiplies it by the coefficient. Use 1.0 by default.

Monitor distance scales sensitivity by a fov aspect ratio defined by the coefficient. Coefficient is a percent of the horizontal where 1.0 is 100%. Don't use 0 here, just use zoom ratio instead.

Keybinds numpad 1-7 for each weapon type:

1 for flamethrowers, MWG, and freezethrower
2 for pistols 
3 for every SMG excluding MP7, Thompson, and Medic SMG 
4 for the grenade launchers
5 for assault rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, and MP7, Thompson, Medic SMG, and Hemoglobin
6 for the lever actions
7 for the husk cannon

I don't have the scoped weapons (crossbow, m14, railgun) working because I don't know the FOV inside scopes or how their sensitivity is calculated.
